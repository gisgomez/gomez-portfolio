# GIS Portfolio
Completed in tandem with 90-753 Advanced GIS with Professor Goranson, Spring 2020.

# About Me
My name is Gisselt Gomez, I am a graduating senior pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Architecture with an additional minor in Politics and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 

I was introduced to the field of geospatial analytics through an introductory GIS/CAFM course taught by Professor Kristen Kurland. I signed up for the course hoping to branch out of the realm of traditional architecture and learn more about a data science approach to the built environment. 

For me, geospatial analytics provides an avenue to combat issues of social and economic equity in urban communities. My long standing passion for public policy and urban planning has only expanded since Professor Kurland's course. Last semester I was in Washington, D.C. completing an internship and coursework for my minor in Politics and Public Policy. While in D.C., I interned at the Office of Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (NY-14) as a Geospatial Data Analyst responsible for building and publishing an interactive web map intended to supplement the congresswoman's "Green New Deal for Public Housing" bill. 

The internship not only gave me the opportunity to apply my GIS knowledge and skills in a professional capacity, but also solidified my commitment to pursuing a long-term career as a geospatial data analyst. After I graduate in May, I hope to work for the City of New York as a GIS specialist focusing on issues like housing, public health, transportation infrastructure, and climate change resiliency planning. 


# Ambitions for the Course 
After my internship last semester, I continued to expand my knowledge on GIS and its practical applications in the realm of policy. The book *Urban Analytics* by Alex Singleton, Seth Spielman and David Folch has helped me understand how local, state and federal governments might use geospatial data for public policy analysis and implementation. It is a great read and inspired me to take this course.

I am thrilled about the opportunity to sharpen my GIS skills and expand my knowledge of how it can be applied in public policy. Through this course, I hope to develop a workflow for GIS, refine my data visualization skills, and improve my data mining and management abilities. I hope to apply my skills and knowledge to a relevant policy area and learn more about industries that have a high demand for GIS professionals. 
  
  
# Portfolio
Course Final Project, completed in collaboration with Victoria Jackson and Muhammad Osama Sakha. 

The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) provided $376 billion in relief to small businesses across the country. As part of those funds, the government appropriated $350 billion to the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) which loans small businesses money to retain workers on payroll. The initial round of funding was exhausted within the first couple weeks of the program, leaving many small businesses unable to apply for federal funding. 

An NPR Marketplace article found that during the first distribution of PPP loans states with smaller populations, like those in the Great Plains and upper Midwest, tended to secure more loan money per capita than more populous states. The article identifies fifteen states of particular interest and suggests that small businesses in these states may have a closer relationship with banks in their area and hence, more access to funds under the PPP. 

The goal of our project is to create a tool to map and analyze the distribution of those funds across the fifteen states identified in the NPR Marketplace news article. Our analysis will seek to more closely look at factors that might influence how much PPP loan money is allocated to a state and will consider the number of SBA recognized small business per state as well as the number of FDIC approved banking locations per state. We hypothesize that states with more FDIC approved banking locations (in relation to the amount of small businesses located in that state) will have higher rates of approved PPP loans.
