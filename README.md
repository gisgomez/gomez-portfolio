# GIS Portfolio
Completed in tandem with 90-753 Advanced GIS with Professor Goranson, Spring 2020.

# About Me
My name is Gisselt Gomez, I am a graduating senior pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Architecture with an additional minor in Politics and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

I was introduced to the field of geospatial analytics through an introductory GIS/CAFM course taught by Professor Kristen Kurland. I signed up for the course hoping to branch out of the realm of traditional architecture and learn more about a data science approach to the built environment. 

For me, geospatial analytics provides an avenue to combat issues of social and economic equity in urban communities. My long standing passion for public policy and urban planning has only expanded since Professor Kurland's course. Last semester I was in Washington, D.C. completing an internship and coursework for my minor in Politics and Public Policy. While in D.C., I interned at the Office of Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (NY-14) as a Geospatial Data Analyst responsible for building and publishing an interactive web map intended to supplement the congresswoman's "Green New Deal for Public Housing" bill. 

The internship not only gave me the opportunity to apply my GIS knowledge and skills in a professional capacity, but also solidified my commitment to pursuing a long-term career as a geospatial data analyst. After I graduate in May, I hope to work for the City of New York as a GIS specialist focusing on issues like housing, public health, transportation infrastructure, and climate change resiliency planning. 


# Ambitions for the Course 
After my internship last semester, I continued to expand my knowledge on GIS and its practical applications in the realm of policy. The book *Urban Analytics* by Alex Singleton, Seth Spielman and David Folch has helped me understand how local, state and federal governments might use geospatial data for public policy analysis and implementation. It is a great read and inspired me to take this course.

I am thrilled about the opportunity to sharpen my GIS skills and expand my knowledge of how it can be applied in public policy. Through this course, I hope to develop a workflow for GIS, refine my data visualization skills, and improve my data mining and management abilities. I hope to apply my skills and knowledge to a relevant policy area and learn more about industries that have a high demand for GIS professionals.

# Customized Google Map Style and Map
This customized Google Maps style was made using the color scheme below, which was derived from an old photo I took when I lived in South Texas.

The customized color scheme allowed me to make changes to how my map rendered. Here is the final product:

Water is typically denoted as blue, so I decided to flip that design convention on its head and make bodies of water white so as to have a blank canvas to start with. I think this stylistic choice makes reading and interpreting the map much easier and clearer.

I decided to use medium blue for highways and roads because I wanted these features to highlight the system of interstate highways in the United States when I zoomed out of a city or particular region.
