# GIS Portfolio
Completed in tandem with 90-753 Advanced GIS, Professor Goranson S20

# About Me
I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Architecture with an additional minor in Politics and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 

I was introduced to the field of geospatial analytics through a introductory GIS/CAFM course taught by Professor Kristen Kurland. I signed up for the course hoping to branch out of the realm of traditional architecture and learn more about a data science approach to the built environment. 

For me, geospatial analytics provides an avenue to combat issues of social and economic equity in urban communities. My longstanding pasion for public policy and urban planning has only expanded since Professor Kurland's course. Last semester I was in Washington, D.C. completing an internship and coursework for my minor in Politics and Public Policy. While in D.C., I interned at the Office of Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (NY-14) as a Geospatial Data Analyst responsible for building and publishing an interactive web map inteded to supplement the congresswoman's "Green New Deal for Public Housing" bill. 

The internship not only gave me the opportunity to apply my GIS knowledge and skills in a professional capacity, but also solidified my committment to pursuing a long-term career as a geospatial data analyst. After I graduate in May, I hope to work for the City of New York as a GIS specialist focusing on issues like housing, public health, transportation infrastructure, and climate change resiliency planning. 


# Ambitions for the Course 
After my internship last semester, I am thrilled about the opportunity to sharpen my GIS skills and expand my knowledge of how it can be applied in public policy.

Throughout this course, I hope to:
    develop a workflow for GIS  
    refine my data visualization skills
  improve my data mining and management abilities
  apply my skills and knowledge to a relevant policy area
  learn more about industries that have a high demand for GIS professionals
